**HTTPlug, the HTTP client abstraction for PHP.**


## Intro

HTTPlug served as a reference is the predecessor of [PSR-18](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/http-client/http-client.md)
HTTP Client standard. Since there is an entire ecosystem built around HTTPlug and since it's already widely adapted,
this package stays available.

This library is the official successor of the [ivory http adapter](https://github.com/egeloen/ivory-http-adapter).
